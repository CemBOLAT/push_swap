# push_swap

## Introduction
The Push_swap project is a straight forward algorithm project that involves sorting data on a stack. You are provided with a set of integer values, 2 stacks, and a set of instructions to manipulate both stacks. Your goal is to write a C program called push_swap that calculates and displays the smallest program, consisting of Push_swap language instructions, to sort the integers received as arguments.

## Mandatory Part
### Rules
- You have 2 stacks named 'a' and 'b'.
- At the beginning:
  - Stack 'a' contains a random amount of negative and/or positive numbers, which cannot be duplicated.
  - Stack 'b' is empty.
- The goal is to sort the numbers in ascending order in stack 'a'. You have various operations at your disposal to achieve this.

### The "push_swap" Program
| Program Name       | push_swap              |
|--------------------|------------------------|
| Turn in Files      | Makefile, *.h, *.c      |
| Makefile Rules     | NAME, all, clean, fclean, re |
| Arguments          | stack 'a' - a list of integers |
| External Functions | read, write, malloc, free, exit |
| Libft Allowed      | Yes                    |


Description: Sort stacks


## Bonus Part
This project provides limited room for adding extra features due to its simplicity. However, you can create your own checker program to verify the correctness of the sorting instructions generated by push_swap.

### The "checker" Program
| Program Name       | push_swap              | checker              |
|--------------------|------------------------|----------------------|
| Turn in Files      | Makefile, *.h, *.c      | *.h, *.c             |
| Makefile Rules     | NAME, all, clean, fclean, re | bonus               |
| Arguments          | stack 'a' - a list of integers | stack 'a' - a list of integers |
| External Functions | read, write, malloc, free, exit | read, write, malloc, free, exit |
| Libft Allowed      | Yes                    | Yes                  |


Description: Execute the sorting instructions

## Suggested Sorting Algorithms (I have used my own selection algorithm)
Here is a list of sorting algorithms you can consider implementing for the project:
- [Bubble Sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort)
- [Selection Sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selection_sort)
- [Insertion Sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insertion_sort)
- [Quick Sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksort)
- [Merge Sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge_sort)
- [Heap Sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heapsort)

Please note that you can implement any sorting algorithm of your choice. These are just some common sorting algorithms to consider.
